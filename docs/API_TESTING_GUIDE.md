# BidVault API Testing & Validation Guide

**Document Status**: Comprehensive Testing Framework  
**Last Updated**: April 12, 2026  
**Purpose**: Systematic testing of all backend APIs before production deployment

### Current Validation Snapshot
- Automated E2E flow: PASS (`backend/e2e-flow.mjs`)
- Frontend production build: PASS (`frontend npm run build`)
- Static diagnostics: no compile/lint diagnostics in modified backend/frontend source files
- Remaining manual check: verify multi-client realtime UI behavior (two browsers) for `leaderboard-update` rendering and winner panel refresh

---

## 5. TESTING EXECUTION PLAN

### Phase 1: API Unit Testing (Start Here)
**Duration**: 1-2 hours  
**Process**: Test each API endpoint individually with cURL or Postman

1. Start backend: `npm run dev`
2. Test auth endpoints (register, login, verify, resend)
3. Test auction endpoints (create, list, details)
4. Test bidding endpoints (place bid, autobid)
5. Test buy-now endpoints
6. Document any failures

### Phase 2: Integration Testing
**Duration**: 2-3 hours  
**Process**: Test complete workflows

1. User creation → email verification → login
2. Auction creation → registration → bidding → ended
3. Buy-now complete flow
4. Auto-bid setup → trigger → outbid
5. Multiple users competing
6. Auction cancellation

### Phase 3: Frontend UI Testing
**Duration**: 2-3 hours  
**Process**: Test UI against actual scenarios

1. Create test auctions with different timing windows
2. Execute all flows from user perspective
3. Verify visuals (buttons, messages, timers)
4. Check responsiveness and error handling
5. Test socket.IO real-time updates
6. Test email notifications

### Phase 4: Edge Case Testing
**Duration**: 1-2 hours  
**Process**: Stress test and verify error handling

1. Rapid bidding (race conditions)
2. Bid placed in last seconds (auction extension)
3. Multiple auto-bids competing
4. Invalid payments/signatures
5. Auction state changes mid-action
6. Network disconnections/Socket.IO reconnection
